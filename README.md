### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Features

-    feature one
-    feature two
-    feature three
-    feature four
-    feature five

##  Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### ReactJS

-    We chose React because everyone on the team knows it and we want to make use of the vast amount of npm packages built just for react.
-    React JS has a really great ways to manage component state. Our team is a huge fan of hooks and the power of Context Api(which is built in the box for react)
-  There is this styling library called Chakra.UI which works really well for our UX vision that is really compatible with react


#### Front end deployed to `https://crime-statistics-master.netlify.com/`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/crime-statistics-for-travelers-be) built using: NodeJS/KNEX/ExpressJS/Posgress

#### Reasons for our backend architecture

-    NodeJS is great for building out rest apis. We took advantage of the wonderful packages built explictly for NodeJS
-    We used Express THE lightweight framework used to build powerful servers. 
-    For Database quering an models we used knexJS. It gives you the power of writing sql queries in a familiar language.
-    We used Postgres to give our data persistence.


# APIs

##  Auth0

Amazing Api for security and easy authentication for the use. It allows for a secure login that goes through the google servers. So no vulnerablities within our application. The only downside is you have to edit your login component in their online editor to style it.

##  Mapbox-gl-js

-Powerful map framework used for visualizing our wonderful planet.

With Mapbox you have the power to travese the world at your finger tips. And with the mapbox geocoder api you can search locations limit searched locations and do much more. We chose mapbox over googlemaps due to its insane custom features.

## FBI Crime Data Explorer

This is our crime data api. We used this api for all of our crime data. Their api is the best for crime data. We researched building out our own dataset and api, but the only documented good data that exists has been created by the FBI.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.
