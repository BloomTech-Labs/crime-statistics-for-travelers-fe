The goal of this project is to make the world a safer place

### 4️⃣ Key Features

-    Geolocation Functionality
-    Filter Through FBI Data
-    Data Visualization
-    Auth0
-    Interactive Map

##  Tech Stack

### Analytics

#### Fullstory

-   We used fullstory to track user habits and click patterns. If you aren't familiar fullstory is an anaytics snippet 
That allows us to see a video replay of our application.

#### Google Analytics
-   We used google analytics to monitor general user data, such as bounce rate, time spent on our platform, Daily Active Users,Basically it gives you general data on the users of an application.

#### Sentry 
-   We set up sentry to monitor and recieve real time bugs that exist within our application. Whenever there is an error anywhere in our application we get a notfication in our Slack.

### Front end built using:

#### ReactJS

-    We chose React because everyone on the team knows it and we want to make use of the vast amount of npm packages built just for react.
-    React JS has a really great ways to manage component state. Our team is a huge fan of hooks and the power of Context Api(which is built in the box for react)
-  There is this styling library called Chakra.UI which works really well for our UX vision that is really compatible with react


#### Front end deployed to `https://crime-statistics-master.netlify.com/`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/crime-statistics-for-travelers-be) built using: NodeJS/KNEX/ExpressJS/Posgress

#### Reasons for our backend architecture

-    NodeJS is great for building out rest apis. We took advantage of the wonderful packages built explictly for NodeJS
-    We used Express THE lightweight framework used to build powerful servers. 
-    For Database quering an models we used knexJS. It gives you the power of writing sql queries in a familiar language.
-    We used Postgres to give our data persistence.


# APIs

##  Auth0

Amazing Api for security and easy authentication for the use. It allows for a secure login that goes through the google servers. So no vulnerablities within our application. The only downside is you have to edit your login component in their online editor to style it.

##  Mapbox-gl-js

-Powerful map framework used for visualizing our wonderful planet.

With Mapbox you have the power to travese the world at your finger tips. And with the mapbox geocoder api you can search locations limit searched locations and do much more. We chose mapbox over googlemaps due to its insane custom features.

We Chose to use Mapbox-gl-js over React-Map-GL and Google Maps due to its insane range of functionality

## FBI Crime Data Explorer

This is our crime data api. We used this api for all of our crime data. Their api is the best for crime data. We researched building out our own dataset and api, but the only documented good data that exists has been created by the FBI.
